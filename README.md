# Prefer Discrete GPU

[![Actions Status](https://github.com/silbinarywolf/preferdiscretegpu/workflows/Go/badge.svg)](https://github.com/silbinarywolf/preferdiscretegpu/actions)

**This is a CGo package. Unfortunately there is no way to enable this behaviour without CGo as of Go 1.14**

For laptops with multiple GPUs, its likely that applications won't launch using the discrete GPU on Windows, but rather the integrated GPU. This can lead to real-time applications like games under-performing by default, which is not the ideal user experience.

This library exports global variables for NVIDIA and AMD drivers so that they use high performance graphics rendering settings.

## Install

```
go get github.com/silbinarywolf/preferdiscretegpu
```

## Requirements

* Golang 1.12+

## How to use

Just import the package for side-effects. This will have no additional behaviour on non-Windows systems.

```go
package main

import (
	"fmt"

	_ "github.com/silbinarywolf/preferdiscretegpu"
)

func main() {
	// your code here
}
```

## How to test if this package is working

1) Open up the Windows Command Line (not Powershell) and run the following:

**NOTE: if you have have an older or newer version of Visual Studio installed, vcvarsall.bat will be in a different folder**
```
call "C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft Visual Studio 14.0\VC\vcvarsall.bat"
```

2) Build the test application that consumes this library
```
go build -v -o testapp.exe ./testapp
```

3) Run dumpbin on it:
```
dumpbin /exports testapp.exe
```

4) It should give you an output mentioning the NVIDIA/AMD constants, like so:
